# SCOPE OF WORK

**Title:** Ensuring HR Confirms New Hires Have Memorized the 10 Basic Principles

---

## 1. Purpose
Our objective is to ensure that Human Resources (HR) transitions from uncertainty (**Situation 0: Not sure**) to certainty (**Situation 1: HR is sure**) regarding whether new hire has memorized the 10 basic principles **verbatim**.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope
- **Process Design**  
  - Design a process demonstrating how HR can reach a definitive state of “knowing sure.”  
  - This process includes a **check step**, requiring the new hire to correctly recite the 10 principles.

---

## 3. Deliverables
A clearly defined process that enables HR to be certain whether each new hire has correctly memorized the 10 basic principles.

---

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

### 4.1 Process Design Team
- **Design & Documentation**  
  - Design the process to verify memorization of the 10 basic principles.  
  - Clearly define the “check step” that HR will use for confirmation.

### 4.2 Human Resources (HR)
- **Ownership of Implementation**  
  - Adopt the process designed by the Process Design Team.  
  - Conduct the check step to verify that new hires can repeat the principles **verbatim**.

---

## 5. Success Criterion
HR has **definite confirmation** when it observes or confirms that a new hire has repeated the 10 basic principles **without any errors**, thereby attaining the “sure” status.

---


## 6. Summary
A **simple and clear check** will be designed and supported by the Process Design Team, enabling HR to confidently ascertain that new hires have memorized the 10 basic principles. This mechanism fulfills the purpose of moving from uncertainty to certainty.
