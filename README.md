## Change Log

| Version | Date | Changes | Reason |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| 1.1 | 18 Apr 2025 | • Shifted timeline dates to reflect the current start (18 Apr 2025). | The original timeline has shifted because the physical verification approach proposed during the design phase was not approved. |
| 1.2 | 18 Apr 2025 | Converted entire schedule to **pure dependency‑based offsets** (no fixed dates). Introduced milestone labels (P₀, C₁, D₁ …) and ripple‑shift rule. | Align fully with requester’s “dependency scheduling / butterfly effect” guidance. |

## 4 — Dependency Schedule/Timeline

| # | Step | Depends On | Duration (h) | Completion |

| 3 | **Documentation Preparation** | **D₁** | 2-3 | **Draft Doc = D₁ + 2-3 h** |
| 4 | **Feedback & Revision** | Draft Doc | 2-3 | **F₁ = Draft Doc + 2-3 h** |
| 5 | **Finalisation & Deployment** | **F₁** | 1-2 | **G₁ = F₁ + 1-2 h** |

> **Ripple Rule:** Any delay at a milestone propagates by the same offset to all subsequent milestones.
