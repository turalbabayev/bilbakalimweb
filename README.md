## 1. Problem Definition

The current situation is that Human Resources (HR) does not have a definitive method to confirm whether new hires have memorized the 10 basic principles **verbatim**.  
The objective is to design a clear and simple process that transitions HR from a state of uncertainty (**Situation 0: Not Sure**) to certainty (**Situation 1: Sure**).

---

## 2. Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder | Role | Impact |
|:------------|:-----|:-------|
| HR Department | Process Owner and Implementer | Must adopt and apply the designed process. |
| Process Design Team | Designer and Documenter | Responsible for creating and documenting the verification process. |

---

## 3. Requirements Classification

### 3.1 Functional Requirements (FR)

| ID | Description |
|:--|:------------|
| FR-1 | HR must be able to verify that a new hire has memorized all 10 principles **verbatim**. |
| FR-2 | The process must include a definitive **check step** to confirm memorization. |
| FR-3 | The designed process must be simple, clear, and reproducible. |

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

| ID | Description |
|:--|:------------|
| NFR-1 | The process must not introduce heavy operational burden. |
| NFR-2 | The process should minimize subjective judgment; it must rely on clear criteria. |

## 4. Open Issues

| Issue ID | Description | Responsible |
|:--------|:------------|:-------------|
| OI-1 | The method of the check (oral, written, form-based) has not been pre-defined. | To be decided in the design phase with multiple alternatives proposed. |
| OI-2 | The timing of the check post-hiring is not specified and considered out of scope. | Out of Scope. |
| OI-3 | No remedial actions for failed checks are within the scope of the task. | Out of Scope. |
| OI-4 | Tools or platforms to be used for the check are not defined and considered out of scope. | Out of Scope. |

---

## 5. Risks

| Risk ID | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|:-------|:------------|:---------------------|
| R-1 | Lack of defined check method may cause delays if requester expects a single finalized method. | Provide multiple design alternatives during the design phase for requester selection. |
| R-2 | Assumptions about timing or HR personnel responsibility could lead to scope creep. | Strictly adhere to the defined scope; raise any change requests formally if needed. |

---

## 6. Approval and Change Management

- The designed process will be shared with the requester for formal approval.
- Any deviation from the defined scope (e.g., timing specification, remedial action flow) must trigger a formal **change request** and must be approved before implementation.
- All updates to requirements must be documented with version control.
