# SCOPE OF WORK
**Project Title:** Ensuring HR Confirms New Hires Have Memorized the 10 Basic Principles

---

## 1. Purpose
Our objective is to ensure that Human Resources (HR) transitions from uncertainty (**Situation 0: Not sure**) to certainty (**Situation 1: HR is sure**) regarding whether each new hire has memorized the 10 basic principles **verbatim**.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope
- **Process Design**  
  - Develop a procedure demonstrating how HR can reach a definitive state of “knowing sure.”  
  - This procedure includes a **check step**, requiring the new hire to correctly recite the 10 principles.

### 2.2 Out of Scope
- How the verification process is conducted (verbal, written, etc.).  
- When and where this verification takes place.  
- Steps taken if the new hire **makes a mistake**.  
- How the 10 principles are initially explained to the employee.  
- Methods to ensure long-term retention after the first check.  
- Whether comprehension of the principles is assessed beyond memorization.

> **Anything not mentioned above is considered out of scope.**

---

## 3. Deliverables
A clearly defined process that enables HR to be certain whether each new hire has correctly memorized the 10 basic principles.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

### 4.1 Process Design Team
- **Development & Documentation**  
  - Create the procedure to verify memorization of the 10 basic principles.  
  - Clearly define the “check step” that HR will use for confirmation.

- **Support & Refinement**  
  - Provide guidance to HR during initial rollout.  
  - Collect feedback and make necessary refinements to the procedure if required.

### 4.2 Human Resources (HR)
- **Ownership of Implementation**  
  - Adopt the procedure designed by the Process Design Team.  
  - Conduct the check step to verify that new hires can repeat the principles **verbatim**.

- **Outcome Recording**  
  - Document the result of each verification to confirm the transition from “not sure” to “sure.”

---

## 5. Success Criterion
HR has **definite confirmation** when it observes or confirms that a new hire has repeated the 10 basic principles **without any errors**, thereby attaining the “sure” status.

---

## 6. Summary
A **simple and clear check** will be designed and supported by the Process Design Team, enabling HR to confidently ascertain that new hires have memorized the 10 basic principles. This mechanism fulfills the purpose of moving from uncertainty to certainty, ensuring alignment with the organization’s foundational values.
