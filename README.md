# **Scope of Work: Ensuring HR’s Certainty of New Hire Memorization of 10 Principles**

## **1. Purpose**
To ensure Human Resources (HR) has **definitive confirmation** that each new hire has memorized the organization’s 10 core principles **verbatim**. Currently, HR is at “Situation 0” (not sure); this scope aims to bring HR to “Situation 1” (sure).

---

## **2. Scope (In Scope)**
Designing a **straightforward process** that enables HR to confidently determine if a new hire can **accurately** recite all 10 principles. This entails:
- Outlining how HR can reach a **state of certainty** regarding each new hire’s memorization.
- Incorporating a **verification step** where the new employee must repeat the 10 principles without error.

> **Anything not explicitly stated as in scope is considered out of scope.**

---

## **3. Out of Scope**
- **Method of Verification** (verbal, written, etc.)  
- **Timing** of the check  
- **Remediation Steps** if a new hire makes a mistake  
- **Location** where the check will occur  
- **Initial Instruction** on these principles for new hires  
- **Post-Verification Retention** strategies  
- **Depth of Assessment** (only memorization vs. comprehension)

---

## **4. Deliverables**
A **documented process** enabling HR to verify—with certainty—that new hires have mastered the 10 principles verbatim.

---

## **5. Success Criterion**
HR achieves **complete assurance** (“sure” status) by **directly observing** or confirming each new hire can recite the 10 principles **flawlessly**.

---

## **6. In Short**
A **simple yet robust** check-in process that elevates HR from “unsure” to **“absolutely sure”** about new employees’ memorization of the 10 core principles.
