- **Remedial Steps** if a new hire fails the verification  
- **Long-Term Retention** measures beyond the initial memorization check  

---

## **4. Deliverables**
1. **Verbatim Verification Procedure**  
   - A succinct manual detailing how HR will confirm that each new hire can recite the 10 principles accurately.
