## 3 — Dependency Schedule

| # | Step | Depends On | Duration (h) | Completion |
|---|------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | **Requirements Review & Clarification** | **P₀** | 2 | **C₁ = P₀ + 2 h** |
| 2 | **Process Design** | **C₁** | 4 | **D₁ = C₁ + 4 h** |
| 3 | **Documentation Preparation** | **D₁** | 3 | **Draft Doc = D₁ + 3 h** |
| 4 | **Feedback & Revision** | Draft Doc | 2 | **F₁ = Draft Doc + 2 h** |
| 5 | **Finalisation & Deployment** | **F₁** | 1 | **G₁ = F₁ + 1 h** |

> **Ripple Rule:** Any delay at a milestone propagates by the same offset to all subsequent milestones.

*Fallback:* If **D₁** (design) is not approved, flow returns to **C₁** for re‑clarification and re‑enters Step 2.
